<p> I am currently a student at the <a href = "https://www.turing.io/" target = "blank">Turing School of Software and Design</a>;
  as such, I spend nearly all my time building things, writing code, asking questions.
  When not learning full stack development,
  I can usually be found with a book, on a bike, or in the trees.</p>
