  <p>My professional background is in education - first in a non-profit, and then in a school. I felt good about what I did and I have worked with wonderful people, both students and colleagues. But I was never challenged by my work, and continuing to learn and grow are priorities for me, both personally and professionally.</p>
  <p>Somewhere along the way, I discovered programming. I started running into problems at work that felt solvable, if only I knew how (the massive excel spreadsheets I wanted to turn into a database with access for our students and families. Everyone has massive excel spreadsheets, right?). </p>
  <p>Since then, I’ve done online tutorials, I’ve written some code (some of which worked, and some of which didn’t), I’ve copied and pasted lines of other people’s code (some of which I understood, and some of which I tried to understand but didn’t), I’ve read books. I’ve learned a lot, but mostly I’ve learned how much I still don’t know. I’ve scratched the surface. But there are already things I love about it.</p>
  <p>There are lots of “right” answers, but lots of wrong ones too. </p>
  <p>It’s simultaneously logical and creative (what an amazing combination!). </p>
  <p>I won’t ever be able to know it all - there’s always something new to learn, something new to try. The technology is always growing and changing. </p>
  <p>Tomorrow, I start at Turing. It’s a scary thing to change careers, to go back to school when I’ve been out and working for so long. But the most valuable things often are. </p>
