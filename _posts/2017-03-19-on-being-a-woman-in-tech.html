  <p>Every woman in tech has a blog post about being a woman in tech. I hesitated to write this one for a couple of reasons. 1. While important, the topic may be a bit tired. See the first sentence. 2. I have never felt marginalized as a woman in tech. This concerns me mostly because I don't want to come accross as dismissive to the experience of other women in tech who do feel marginalized. On the contrary - their experience is real and valid. But this is mine, and it is also real and valid, and I may not be the only one feeling it.</p>
  <p>Of course, I am not just a woman in tech. I am a white, privileged woman in tech. My impression is that the issue of gender, even for those who do feel it more acutely than I do, is actually minor compared to other issues of diversity - namely that being a person of color is a much bigger issue than is being female. Women have higher representation in the field than do people of color. Additionally, while both women and other marginalized populations are trending in the right direction in terms of representation in the field, my impression is that it is happening much faster for women. This probably comes down to access - I often feel like in order to solve the issue of racial diversity in the tech field, we'll first have to solve poverty - or at least the issue of equal access to technology and technology education for young people and students.</p>
  <p><strong>So am I just oblivious?</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe.</p>
  <p>Articles like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/12/women-considered-better-coders-hide-gender-github">this one</a> would imply so. The wage gap is well documented and factual, but I've also seen many studies that show it comes largely from women's disinclination to negotiate for higher salaries. That is certialy a cultural or societal construction that needs to be addressed, but it doesn't mean companies and hiring managers are inherently biased.  </p>
  <p>I've heard antectdotes from my female peers of sexual harrassment and physical intimidation and double standards related to communication styles. I've heard from a couple female Turing graduates that they have been mistaken for administrative assistants in their jobs as developers, presumably because they are female. Just because these things haven't happened to me doesn't mean they don't happen, I know this. </p>
