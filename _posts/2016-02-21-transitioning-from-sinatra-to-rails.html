<div class="post-contents">
<p> We made our first foray into Rails today, and because we wrote our Sinatra apps in the MVC model, the transition was jarring mostly in the simplicity of it - how many things Rails does for me, that I had to create for myself in Sinatra. For example, this in Rails:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/adriennedomingus/2eed3cf03e479f916825.js"></script>
<p>Replaces this, in Sinatra:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/adriennedomingus/f6b259e551c6bbb6f823.js"></script>
<p>That's not quite accurate. The first snippet automatically creates all seven of the routes shown above and automatically links them to their controller and action, but doesn't actually create the code that fulfills the logic side of things. The views still need to be rendered in the controllers with their accompanying logic. To see that these routes actually exist and where they point, run <span class="code">rake routes</span> in your command line, and you'll get this for the above example:</p>
<img class="command-line" src="/images/2016-02-21/01.png" alt="image 01" />
<p>This tells me I now need to create the <span class="code">teachers_controller</span> file that has actions for <span class="code">index</span>,<span class="code">create</span>, <span class="code">new</span>, <span class="code">edit</span>, <span class="code">show</span>, <span class="code">update</span>, and <span class="code">destroy</span> within it. </p>
